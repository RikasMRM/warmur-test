        But calculators abound, you say! There are several calculators online
        which let you estimate your solar energy production, and some of them
        also model the impact of installing a battery. Others still can give you
        an idea of your heat pump running costs. A few calculators combine all
        of these technologies to give you a more complete view. By answering a
        few simple questions about your home and habits, we&apos;ll show you your
        projected savings from combining not just solar, battery & heat pump,
        but also off-peak electricty tarrifs, a crucial component of considering
        your future home energy bills. It&apos;s our mission to build the most
        intuitive home energy calculator, helping you decarbonise your home,
        minimising running costs. Warmur is the missing calculator for
        navigating your path to a #NetZero home.
